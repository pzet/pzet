# Hello!

I'm a PhD student in semiconductor physics that decided to change the carreer path to one involving more programming and data analysis. I love working with data but I decided I'd like to work with datasets larger than the ones I can produce in the physics lab.

- I'm currently working on:
    - my PhD about artificial synapses for neuromorphic computing and hardware neural networks

- I'm currently learning:
    - Python - I'm a self-taught programmer, still trying to improve my skills
    - databases - data modeling, cloud architectures


- My projects:
    - [Spotify Tracks History](https://github.com/pzet/spotify-tracks-history) - API that connects to Spotify and downloads your last played songs into PostgreSQL relational database.
    - [Expense Tracker](https://github.com/pzet/ZrozumSQL_projekt) - designed and implemented database to keep track of a home budget and expenses.
    - [MNIST Digit Recognizer](https://github.com/pzet/Digit-Recognizer) - Convolutional Neural Network capable of recognizing handwritten digits with high accuracy (when submitted, it got into top 16% accuracies on Kaggle)
    - [COVID-19 in Poland](https://nbviewer.org/github/pzet/COVID_Poland/blob/master/covid_polska.ipynb) - data analysis and interactive visualization of COVID-19 cases in Poland (no longer updated)


- My courses:
    - ZrozumSQL - I learned SQL and relational databases
    - Udacity DataEngineering - currently pursuing
    - PL/SQL course - currently pursuing
